# ---------- STATIC METHODS ----------
 
# Static methods allow access without the need to initialize
# a class. They should be used as utility methods, or when
# a method is needed, but it doesn't make sense for the real
# world object to be able to perform a task
 
class Sum:
 
    # You use the static method decorator to define that a
    # method is static
    @staticmethod
    def getSum(*args):
 
        sum = 0
 
        for i in args:
            sum += i
 
        return sum
 
def main():
 
    # Call a static method by proceeding it with its class
    # name
